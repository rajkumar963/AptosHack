# AptosHack 🚀

AptosHack is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the **Aptos blockchain** using the **Move programming language**.  
This project was developed as part of a hackathon to showcase the power of Aptos smart contracts and demonstrate how blockchain can enable fast, secure, and scalable decentralized applications.

## 🌟 Introduction
AptosHack is designed to leverage the **Aptos blockchain** to provide a seamless decentralized experience.  
Unlike traditional Ethereum-based DApps that use Solidity, AptosHack is powered by **Move smart contracts** which are optimized for safety and efficiency.  

The application demonstrates how blockchain can be applied in real-world use cases like:
- Decentralized identity
- Token transfers
- Smart contract-based automation
- Transparent governance

---

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Smart contracts written in **Move** for Aptos
- ✅ Decentralized front-end for interaction
- ✅ Wallet integration (e.g., Petra, Martian)
- ✅ Secure transactions with Aptos blockchain
- ✅ Scalable design for hackathon deployment

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js / Next.js (TypeScript, TailwindCSS)
- **Backend (if any):** Node.js / Express.js
- **Smart Contracts:** Move language on Aptos
- **Blockchain:** Aptos testnet / devnet
- **Wallets Supported:** Petra, Martian
- **Other Tools:** Git, GitHub Actions, Hackathon Dev Tools
